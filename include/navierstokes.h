  /** \brief The incompressible Navier Stokes equation solver.
   *
   * This program is built upon dealii tutorials step-57, step-22, step-20.
   * We use fully implicit scheme for time stepping.
   * At each time step, Newton's method is used to solve for the update,
   * so we define two variables: the present solution and the update.
   * Additionally, the evaluation point is for temporarily holding
   * the updated solution.
   * We use one ConstraintMatrix for Dirichlet boundary conditions
   * at the initial step and a zero ConstraintMatrix for the rest steps.
   * Although the density does not matter in the incompressible flow, we still
   * include it in the formulation in order to be consistent with the
   * slightly compressible flow. Correspondingly the viscosity represents
   * the dynamic visocity \f$\mu\f$ instead of the kinetic visocity \f$\nu\f$,
   * and the pressure block in the solution is the real pressure.

     * \f}
     *
     * \f$\tilde{A}\f$ is unsymmetric thanks to the convection term.
     * We do not have a nice way to deal with other than using a direct
     * solver. (Geometric multigrid is the right way to go if only you are
     * brave enough to implement it.)
     *
     * \f$\tilde{S}^{-1}\f$ is the inverse of the total Schur complement,
     * which consists of a reaction term, a diffusion term, a Grad-Div term
     * and a convection term.
     * In practice, the convection contribution is ignored because it is not
     * clear how to treat it. But the block preconditioner is good enough even
     * without it. Namely,
     *
     * \f[
     *   \tilde{S}^{-1} = -(\nu + \gamma)M_p^{-1} -
     * \frac{1}{\Delta{t}}{[B(diag(M_u))^{-1}B^T]}^{-1}
     * \f]
     * where \f$M_p\f$ is the pressure mass, and \f${[B(diag(M_u))^{-1}B^T]}\f$
     * is an
     * approximation to the Schur complement of (velocity) mass matrix
     * \f$BM_u^{-1}B^T\f$.
     *
     * In summary, in order to form the BlockSchurPreconditioner for our system,
     * we need to compute \f$M_u^{-1}\f$, \f$M_p^{-1}\f$, \f$\tilde{A}^{-1}\f$
     * and them operate on them.
     * The first two matrices can be easily defined indirectly with CG solver,
     * and the last one is going to be solved with direct solver.
